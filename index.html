       Hi! My name is Shreyashi Kalakuntla and I am currently a junior at Northeastern University majoring in Business Administration and Data Science with concentrations in Finance and Accounting. I am interested in exploring the intersection of finance, data, and AI. What excites me most is how AI is becoming a bridge between finance and data science, opening new ways to analyze information, predict outcomes, and automate complex processes. I am fascinated by how these technologies can make financial systems more transparent and efficient, but also how they can extend into healthcare by improving patient outcomes, optimizing resources, and creating more equitable solutions. Throughout my coursework at Northeastern I have enjoyed learning how financial modeling, coding, and data visualization all come together to tell meaningful stories and drive decision-making. Working with data has helped me see how powerful small insights can be when applied thoughtfully and creatively to solve meaningful challenges. I’m also curious about how AI ethics and data responsibility will shape the future of finance and healthcare as technology continues to evolve. Ultimately, I hope to build a career that combines analytical thinking, creativity, and technology to solve complex problems and create real-world impact across industries worldwide.
