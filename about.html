             My experiences so far have allowed me to see how the connection between finance, data, and AI works beyond the classroom. As a Sophomore Summer Analyst at Wells Fargo, I gained exposure to different areas of the business and learned how data-driven insights strengthen financial decision-making. Working on an internal audit project and pro-bono consulting initiative taught me how collaboration and analytics come together to solve meaningful challenges. Through the Girls into VC Fellowship, I have been able to dive deeper into how AI is transforming investing - especially in healthcare. Conducting market research on AI driven healthcare startups helped me understand how technology, finance, and innovation intersect to drive progress. I also helped design Loan Pilot, a fintech app prototype created for the Disrupt Finovate Competition. My team’s goal was to simplify loan management through data visualization and use-centered design. Beyond professional experiences, I serve as Team Lead for First Byte guiding STEM workshops for younger students. It’s been rewarding to spark curiosity in others while strengthening my own leadership and communication skills. Each of these experiences has deepened my passion for using data and technology to make a real, lasting impact.
